title: The Bloccit, an unexpected journey.

My experience at Bloc, an unexpected lesson.

I had been playing around with Ruby for a few months via free coding websites and wanted to take some sort of lessons to really understand the language. An online course was best for me since I live in a very small town with very few opportunities. Also, I needed to be home with my two young children during my course. I found Bloc and it sounded perfect! What REALLY sold me on bloc.io was having my very own mentor and the promise of help with a portfolio as well as job prep. I couldn’t wait to get started.

After figuring out how I was going to pay for my course, I immediately enrolled in the Rails Web Development course. I had to wait about 12 days to start and I could not wait!

While I was waiting, I did some free courses online in preparation. I had completed a couple previous to this so it really wasn’t too difficult. Then the day finally came!

My mentor was a young software engineer from San Diego. I really admired her work ethic and we got along really well. I was really excited to be able to work her.

My course started off with some Ruby basics, which was pretty simple since I had been doing some Ruby stuff on my own. My mentor was really helpful and I was enjoying myself a lot. 

Then I hit the point in the course where territory was unfamiliar. Here was the challenge I knew was coming! I had a ton of questions form mentor, but she seemed to be too busy to answer. I scoured the internet and the found answers on my own, mostly through stackoverflow.com. Bloc also has a Slack channel and a Facebook page called Bloc Hackers Club. I found both of these resources very helpful as well! 

About a month into my course, my mentor was canceling or rescheduling appointments often and was very difficult to get ahold of. This was an expensive course! I chose Bloc because of the opportunity to have a mentor. I felt I wasn't getting the full attention I needed. I realized that my mentor had a full-time career and that was her main priority. But I also realized that I needed someone with more time. 

So, I sent my mentor an email explaining my feelings and sent in my request for a new mentor. My new mentor seemed knowledgeable and excited to work with me and I was really excited to work with him as well!

By the time my new mentor was involved, I was wrapping up the theory part of the course and moving on to actually building an application called Bloccit, a Reddit replica. I was so excited to put my new found knowledge to use. Little did I know the journey that lay ahead.

And so began work on the Bloccit application. Right away I had a ton of questions. So naturally, I turned to my new mentor. He was very helpful and knowledgeable, as expected. As time went on, it seemed I was running into the same problems I had with my first mentor. Unanswered questions galore. But this time was worse! He would actually completely blow off our meetings and rarely answer my questions via Skype. What had I done? I was better off with my first mentor. 

I didn’t want to waste anymore time searching for mentors. I needed to concentrate on my course. So that is exactly what I did. My new mentor would occasionally answer my questions and occasionally make our scheduled meetings, but I knew I couldn’t count on that. I took what I could get from him and continued to found the vast majority of my answers online.

My time with my new mentor became scarce and then nonexistent. I ended up flying completely solo for my capstone project, portfolio and job prep.

I learned a lot with my coursework through Bloc. A lot of Ruby, some HTML, CSS and even a little Javascript! The biggest lesson I learned though was how to figure it out on my own. I am actually thankful for the lack of help from my second mentor. Now I can say I did it by myself. And I am very proud of that.
