short-description: Build a production quality SaaS app that allows users to create their own wikis.

##Explanation

Blocipedia is a Wikipedia replica with unique user functionality using the devise gem and send grid for email user verification. It was the third real application I ever made and it proved to be a little bit of a challenge. 

##Problem

During my course work with bloc.io, I was guided lesson by lesson in building a Reddit replica application called Bloccit. The Wiki replica would be very similar, so I knew I had the skills to build this. The problem I had with this application was designing a layout. I had been instructed on Ruby coding but knew very little about web design.

##Solution

So I turned to Google and found a YouTube video of a rails application. I really liked the color scheme and decided to use that as a base. 

##Results

The result is a functioning app with an appealing background. This is a work in progress as far as the design goes, but here are a few screen shots of my work with Blocipedia:

Wikis edit page:

##Conclusion

Perserverance is key, and the more I code the more this is evident. The answers are out there and after completing this application, I had found even more resources!
