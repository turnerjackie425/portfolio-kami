## Explanation

Bloccit is a reddit replica that I built through my course work at bloc.io. It was a guided learning experience, for the most part. This is where the majority of my learning happened. I had been doing all the theory, but now it was time to put it to work.


Since this was my first real applciation beyond the typical 'hello world' everyone startsout with, this was the first time I had really worked withthe MVC model. Once I understood it, things went realtively smoothly. My mentor was a great help with this.

## Problem

Things don't always go as planned, even in a guided application build. The layout was all wrong (even though I had done everyting as told!) and my mentor wasn't always available! He had a full-time career and a family on top of having to babysit me!


## Solution

Stackoverflow was the answer! I cannot praise that site and the people who contrubute on it enough. Since building Bloccit, I have used stackoverflow.com pretty much daily. 

## Results

The result is an application that won the approval of my mentor! I had done it! 

## Conclusion

You can't count on anyone else to find the answers for you, in life or in programming! There are a ton of resources out there, you just need to know where to look.
