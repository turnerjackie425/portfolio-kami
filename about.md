"Complaining about a problem without posing a solution is called whining." -Teddy Roosevelt. 

I couldn't agree with ol' Teddy more. I have struggled with a career path since graduating high school in 2000. The small town I grew up in offers very little for career opportunities.  I knew an education was important for me. But what did I want to do when I grew up?

So I spent my early 20’s ’whining’ and working various jobs from bartending to customer service at a motorcycle shop parts counter. I also became involved in advertising through a local newspaper, which then turned into a job with the web services department. After that I became a stay-at-home mom. 7 years later, I found myself needing to find a career.

That’s when I found Ruby on Rails, and I fell in love. This was the solution to the problem I had been searching for! I finally realized what I wanted to be when I grow up, A PROGRAMMER!!! Full of ambition and anxious to become a great programmer, I enrolled in bloc.io and have now completed the course. 

Within a few short weeks at Bloc, I was making my own Ruby applications using erb, html and css. I still have much to learn but have the ability and the drive to take it all on.  Learning to code will be a career-long journey, and I am enthusiastically awaiting to embark on that adventure.

 I look forward to the day when I can say, “I worked hard, succeeded and provided a great life for my family.”  I finally have the solution in my hands!
